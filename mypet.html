  <h1>Robert the cat</h1>

  <p>
    I adopted him from a feline rescue in California. It took him a long time to get used to his new living conditions, but he eventually came to trust me. Now, four years later, I'm still the only person he will let get anywhere near him.

  <p>Here is a list of his likes and dislikes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Likes:</li>

      <li>Belly rubs</li>
      <li>Toe biting</li>
      <li>Arm licking</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dislikes:</li>
    <ul>

      <li>Unexpected movement</li>
      <li>Other living creatures</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>He is gray and white.</p>
